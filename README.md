# Card Game

This is a repository for the rules of a card game we're developing.

## How to play

### Objective

The game is a trick taking game. The objective of the game is to win 40 points by taking tricks accross several rounds. Each player plays with their own full 52 card deck. At any one time you will have 13 'active cards' which make up your 'draw pile', 'discard pile' and hand. 

### During play

At the start of the round you draw five cards from your draw pile. 
If there aren't enough cards in your draw pile shuffle your discard pile; this becomes your draw pile once you draw the remaining cards you need for this round.
One player will be the 'lead'; they lead the first trick and the winner of each trick leads the next.
Hearts is the trump suit, but you are not obligated to trump your opponent unless they led with trumps.
Because each player is using their own deck it is possible for there to be draws; when this happens, both players count as winning the trick and the player who led that trick leads the next as well.
When all tricks have been played put the cards used from your own deck into your discard pile and add the number of tricks you won to your point total.
In the next round the other player is the 'lead'.

Before trick taking begins in each round, however, there is an opportunity to improve the quality of your active cards.
You 'upgrade' your active cards by discarding a heart from your hand, drawing a card from your deck then permanently disposing of any card from your hand (this can be the card you just drew).
Starting with the lead, each player has the opportunity to 'upgrade' as many times as they can discard a heart. 
When the leads stops and 'sticks' with their hand then the other player has the opportunity to 'upgrade'.

You might have realised that upgrading results in having one fewer card in your hand (discard one \[-1\], draw one \[+1\], dispose one \[-1\]). 
This means that the two players may have different numbers of cards in hand; in that case, when the one player runs out of cards their opponent wins one trick for card remaining in their hand. 

### Set up

Each player finds all four 2s from their deck plus the 3 of hearts.
They shuffle the remainder of their deck and deal themselves eight more cards without looking at them.
These thirteen cards are your starting draw pile - shuffle them all together and place them face down next to you.
Choose a player to lead first.
You're now ready to begin.

### Suggested Layout

I think this section may be a little confusing, but I'll do my best to explain how we're actually moving things around.

We keep score on a phone using the mobile app 'KeepScore' which we place on the table between us off to one side ('score side').
Each of us places our deck (that is, cards that have never been active cards) oriented landscape slightly closer to us on the score side. 
Closer to us still but still on the score side, we place our draw pile oriented portrait.
When we need a discard pile, it lives face up adjacent to the draw pile.
When we dispose of cards, we put them on the opposite side to score side face up.

When a player leads for the first time in a round, they play their card on their side (in line with their deck) next to the score side in a portrait orientation.
The other player lays the card they are playing opposite it, in a landscape position if they think they've lost the trick or a portrait position if they have won (or if it's a draw).
If that player has won the trick, the leading player turns their card to a portrait orientation.
This process is repeated for each subsequent trick in the round.
This helps with counting up tricks at the end of the round. 

## Glossary
