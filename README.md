# Card Game

This is a repository for the rules of a card game we're developing.

## How to play

The game is a trick taking game. The objective of the game is to win 40 tricks accross several rounds. Each player plays with their own full 52 card deck. At any one time you will have 13 'active cards' which make up your 'draw pile', 'discard pile' and hand. 

In each round you will have 5 (or sometimes fewer*) cards in your hand.
One player will be the 'lead'; they lead the first trick and the winner of each trick leads the next.
Hearts is the trump suit, but you are not obligated to trump your opponent unless they led with trumps.
If one player runs out of cards in their hand while the other has not, the player with cards left wins one trick for each remaining card.
Because each player is using their own deck it is possible for there to be draws; when this happens, both players count as winning the trick and the player who led that trick leads the next as well.
When all tricks have been played put the cards used from your own deck into your discard pile.
At the end of the round you draw five cards from your draw pile. 
If there aren't enough cards in your draw pile shuffle your discard pile; this becomes your draw pile once you draw the remaining cards you need.
